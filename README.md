# TIME CIRCUITS

- The Time Circuits represent a small personal project that I developed while exploring the fundamentals of JavaScript. The concept is inspired by the Back to the Future franchise (obviously).

## About Development

- I created this project during my early days of learning JavaScript, primarily as a means to explore interactions between JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Fueled by my enthusiasm for Back to the Future, I dedicated time to it throughout a month while working full time. Although there are still some CSS issues and the JavaScript code is a bit unorganized, this project stands as one of my first endeavors in the realm of self-taught programming, and I am extremly proud of it.


## Planned Updates

- Fix issue with AM/PM buttons
- Fix placement of CSS divs to make application more contained.
